                        impossible to not get confused! Well this is just the guide you've been looking for! I will break down the various parts of Tarot so you can

                        Tarot is a divinitory practice involving a deck cards. Typically this deck is 78 cards broken down into 22 Major Arcana cards
                        and 56 Minor Arcana cards (which I will go into further detail below). Contrary to popular belief, Tarot is not used to predict
                        the future. Tarot is designed to act more like a therapist- a mirror that will echo your thoughts challenging you to discover
                        deep-hidden thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. Ideally you can use this information to improve all areas of your life including love, life, 
                        emotions, career, health, and more.

                    <h2>History of Tarot</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tarot began as a deck for card games in the mid-15th century around various parts of Europe. It was used for various games, many of which are 
                        still played today. It wasn't until late in the 18th century that Tarot cards became part a divinitory practice. In 1789 the first Tarot deck 
                        designed for divinitory or occult purposes was issued by Jean-Baptiste Alliette. A common belief was that the cards had originated from the book
                        of Thoth, and so the deck centered around themes pertaining to Ancient Egypt. Since then, many interpretations of the Tarot deck have been 
                        published, but they typically represent the same meaning with different illustrations. Common deck themes today are the Tarot of Marseilles, 
                        the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck, and the Thoth tarot deck.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Purpose of Tarot</h2>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of Tarot is to help one take an inward journey to discover parts of themselves hidden deep underneath the surface. However,
                        there are various ways this can be achieved and thus various types of readings to aid this journey.

                            Divination Tarot Reading: This type of reading is intended to gain insight for current and future situations. This typically involves the 
                            belief in a higher power to guide the way.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Psycholgical Tarot Reading: The importance of tarot symbolism was attached by the first psychologist, Carl Jung. He may have regarded the 
                            tarot cards by representing archetypes: situations embedded in the subconscious of all human being or fundamental types of person.

                        <li>
                            Tarot as a mnemonic device: Symbolic study or some schools of occult thought like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn consider tarot as 
                            a mnemonic device or textbook for their teachings. This might be the cause for the world arcana, which is used to convey the meaning of two 
                            sections of the tarot deck. It is the plural form of the Latin word Arcanum that means secret or closed.

                        It's a common misconception that Tarot cards tell the future. The cards themselves do not tell the future. However, the person seeking
                        guidance will be able to make sense of what each card represents and how that applies to them. Through this insight a person can peer into 
                        their own intuition. In a typical reading, the querent will start by shuffling the cards with specific questions in mind. Then the querent will 
                        lay the cards in a spread out fashion facedown. Then they choose cards one by one and hands them to the reader until the spread has been 
                        completed. As the reader lays down the cards they will receive impressions and intuitive ideas in their subconscious mind to help answer
                        the questions accurately.

                    Beginners will typically make use of a reference book to assist with interpreting the meaning of cards as they come up in spreads. The best way for
                    beginners to truly learn the meaning of the cards is to start by feeling the card. Take in its imagry as a whole and pay attention to what feelings
                    the imagry invokes. Do your best to think deeply about what this card could be trying to tell you. Look at it much deeper than the illustration.
                    Do your best to give what's happening a chance to represent something. It is best to write this interpretation down, then reference the classic 
                    meaning of the card and take note of this as well. As you continue to pull cards and make your way through the entire deck, you will piece 
                    together the story of the Tarot as a whole. The story of you, as a whole.

                    There are a few customs in regards to Tarot readings as well as caring for the decks themselves. First, it is customary to prepare an area for doing
                    readings. Some will even perform rituals as part of the prepartion to do a reading. This could include burning incense, altering the lighting, 
                    meditating, or whatever else makes you feel more at ease and connected to the ethereal. As for taking cares of your deck, there are a few 
                    methods that you can mix and match as you please. Some readers keep their cards wrapped in a silk scarf, in a cloth bag, or inside a box. You can 
                    choose to integrate all of these into caring for your cards. It is important to protect your cards from negative energy as well as shield them from
                    physical damage as well.

                            which usually is an indicator for the query at hand. This is an effective form of reading which comprises all the zodiac signs and gives
