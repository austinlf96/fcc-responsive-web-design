                <p>Leonardo da Vinci (04/15/1452-05/02/1519) was a prodigy to say the least. During the span of his lifetime
                he would go on to achieve several accomplishments recognized by artists, inventors, military strategists, doctors, and everyday people.
                That's not all though. Leonardo had numerous characteristics and habits that were intriguing. First off, he was known to write in reverse.
                This made in only possible to read his writing when held up to a mirror. Some theories on the matter were that Leonardo was left-handed. However,
                research later confirmed that Leonardo was ambidextrous. He also had a habit of finishing his projects very slowly and sometimes not at all- a habit
                that Michelangelo would later use to attack Leonardo's reputation. The Mona Lisa, for example, is one his many works that Leonardo da Vinci never 
                completed. A few of Mr. da Vinci's most famous works and inventions, some of which are completed, are listed below.
